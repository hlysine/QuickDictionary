## How to use

### Input a word

You can just type in a word in the search box and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>, but that's too much work. Here are some alternatives, sorted from lazy to the laziest:

#### 1. Hit <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd>

![search box](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25472513/132482496-6a48ac36-79a0-4060-9a5c-9fef39c24abf.png)

Pressing <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> from anywhere will bring up QuickDictionary and focus the text box for you, so you can start typing right away.

#### 2. Use the clipboard

![clipboard toggle](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25472513/132482837-88dd5fc1-455f-4169-be75-4f6aa520de71.png)

QuickDictionary will look for words in the clipboard by default. Simply highlight a word from anywhere and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to look it up. Press the pause button to turn this feature off.

#### 3. Use OCR

![OCR viewfinder](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25472513/132484376-5ef14c35-efe9-4ba9-b1a2-b6af2aed7b3e.png)


Press the eye icon or hit <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>G</kbd> to open the viewfinder, then tap any word on the screen to look it up instantly. This is the most convenient way for touchscreens. Scroll up/down to adjust the size of the viewfinder box. You are good to go as long as the box is larger than the word. Press <kbd>Esc</kbd> to cancel the selection.

#### 4. Use smart tooltips (BETA)

![auto pop-up mode](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25472513/132485981-8be69bf8-cdb8-426e-973a-4ba8c05754c2.png)

![smart tooltip](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25472513/132485713-7b7a7cf2-3590-425b-a52b-f37cc9492397.png)

Press the eye icon while holding <kbd>Shift</kbd> to enable smart tooltips. In this mode, simply hover your mouse on a word for a moment, a tooltip will soon pop up defining the word for you. Press the eye icon again to turn it off.

> This feature is BUGGY. If any problems arise, toggle the tooltip off and on again, or restart QuickDictionary.

### Look the word up in dictionaries

![dictionary list](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25472513/132486855-75bd5098-c23a-4df9-beb4-1dce2ae9c7ec.png)

QuickDictionary can search for the same word in multiple dictionaries simutaneously, combining the power of them all to bring you the best definitions while saving you time. A list of available dictionaries is available in the toolbar. Click on them to toggle them on or off. Numbers at the corner describe their order of preference.

![side drawer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25472513/132487146-c78da52a-e160-4b0a-b9f8-717e954d2031.png)

Expand the drawer on the right to see a list of dictionaries that contain definitions for the current word. Click on them to see the word defined in different dictionaries.

### Save the word

![save the word](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25472513/132487687-611bb877-9f17-4c48-afe2-fcd739b7bcd9.png)

Press the button at the bottom-right corner to save the word in a word list. 

![edit word details](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25472513/132488002-98406291-9487-4d21-8456-65c6de00f733.png)

Word details are automatically filled in for you, but you may edit them however you want. Simply select a word list to save the word to (or create a new one), then press **save**.

![manage word lists](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25472513/132488284-97639b4f-b23a-4ce9-a3b8-5797ca0361be.png)

Press "manage word lists" to bring up the word list manager. You may review, edit and delete the words here. Use flashcard mode to aid memorization, and click on a word to go back to the dictionary page.
